* Ergonomic Emacs Keyboard Layout for Thinkpads

On my Desktop I use a [[https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php][Truly Ergonomic Keyboard]]
in conjunction with xah-fly-keys or ergoemacs modes for emacs,
 and the [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/Truly_Ergonomic_keyboard_layout.html][ergoemacs-xah Mode Layout, Dvorak from Xah Lee]].

Because I dont find it to ergonomic to sit long hours on the desk, 
I thought of a way to have some similar ergonomic experience with a notebook.

Thinkpad have pretty good laptop keyboards, they are often descriped to have a mechanical feeling.
But they have normal country specific keyboard layouts.

The main problem with the common keyboard layout especialy for programmer is in my oppinion the lack
of many thumb keys, so you stress out your pinky to much, instead of using your strong thumb.

So I looked around and saw that the japanese Layout has much more thumb keys. great what I searched for.
But they still use the normal layout, so mapped not the most used keys to this thumb keys.

So I figured out how to map the keys the way I want and this is the result.
